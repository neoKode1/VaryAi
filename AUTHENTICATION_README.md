# 🔐 VaryAI Authentication System

## Overview
VaryAI now includes a complete authentication system built with Supabase, allowing users to:
- Use the app anonymously with 3 free generations
- Create accounts for unlimited generations
- Save their work permanently
- Sync across devices

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Extended user profiles with preferences and usage stats
- **Galleries Table**: Stores user-generated content (images/videos)
- **Usage Tracking Table**: Tracks generation usage for analytics

### Authentication Flow
1. **Anonymous Users**: Can use the app with 3 free generations
2. **Sign Up**: Email verification required, localStorage data migrated to database
3. **Sign In**: Full access to saved galleries and unlimited generations

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Authentication
- [x] Email/password authentication
- [x] Email verification for new accounts
- [x] Password reset functionality
- [x] Session management
- [x] Automatic logout on token expiry

### ✅ User Management
- [x] User profiles with preferences
- [x] Usage statistics tracking
- [x] Gallery management (localStorage ↔ database)
- [x] Data migration on sign-up

### ✅ Usage Limits
- [x] 3 free generations for anonymous users
- [x] Unlimited generations for authenticated users
- [x] Real-time usage tracking
- [x] Usage counter UI

### ✅ UI Components
- [x] Authentication modal (sign in/up/reset)
- [x] Header with user menu
- [x] Usage limit banners
- [x] Save to account prompts

```

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env.local` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://sjjzsjchpurdwldcdrdb.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### 2. Database Setup
Run the SQL commands in `database-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
-- Creates tables, indexes, RLS policies, and triggers
-- Automatically creates user profiles on signup
-- Tracks usage statistics
```

### 3. Test Connection
```bash
node test-supabase.js
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### Anonymous Users
1. **First Visit**: Can immediately start generating
2. **Usage Counter**: Shows "Free Generations: X/3"
3. **Limit Reached**: Banner appears with sign-up prompt
4. **Save Work**: Option to create account and save current work

### Authenticated Users
1. **Unlimited Access**: No generation limits
2. **Persistent Gallery**: Work saved permanently
3. **Cross-Device Sync**: Access from any device
4. **Usage Stats**: Track generation history

## 🧪 Testing

### Local Testing
1. Start the development server
2. Test anonymous usage (3 generations)
3. Create a test account
4. Verify data migration
5. Test sign in/out flow

### Database Testing
```bash
# Test Supabase connection
node test-supabase.js

# Check database tables
# Verify RLS policies
# Test user creation trigger
```

## 🚀 Deployment
